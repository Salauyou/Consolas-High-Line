Consolas-High-Line
==================
Version of widely used `Consolas` font family with increased line-height.

I love `Consolas` because of its native state-of-the-art bold and italic fonts and excellent hinting. But I hate how it looks in Eclipse IDE, I mean line-height: lines appear so close to each other and thus hard to read. So I took original `Consolas` font family and increased line-height in every font--to make them look much more nice and readable in Eclipse.
